# PSP Project Setup Complete ✅

Generated: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Repository Structure ✅
- Cloned PSP repository with existing monorepo structure
- Created agent/bootstrap branch for development
- Configured git with PSP Development Agent identity

### 2. Master Planning ✅
- **ops/psp-master-plan.md**: Complete 5-phase execution strategy
- **ops/init-context.md**: Repository state assessment
- Comprehensive task breakdown for all phases

### 3. Phase 1 Detailed Task Files ✅
Created detailed task files with acceptance criteria:
- **01-code-standards.md**: Semantic release, husky, conventional commits, API docs
- **02-core-protocol.md**: Session schema, encryption, storage providers, CRDT merge
- **03-adapters.md**: Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, Browserless, CF Workers adapters
- **04-developer-tools.md**: CLI, GUI, VS Code extension development
- **05-testing-ci.md**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E, CI/CD pipeline
- **06-documentation.md**: Docusaurus site, quickstart, security whitepaper

### 4. GitHub Project Created ✅
- **Project Name**: PSP - PersistentSessionsProtocol Development
- **Project ID**: PVT_kwHOADF9zs4A9CEd
- **Project Number**: 4
- **URL**: https://github.com/users/samihalawa/projects/4

### 5. Git Commits & Push ✅
- All planning files committed with conventional commit message
- Pushed to agent/bootstrap branch
- Ready for PR creation: https://github.com/samihalawa/PSP-PersistentSessionsProtocol/pull/new/agent/bootstrap

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Create Pull Request** from agent/bootstrap to main
2. **Add tasks to GitHub Project** using the detailed task files
3. **Set up project fields** (Status, Priority, Phase, Assignee)
4. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** starting with code standards

### Phase 1 Implementation Order:
1. Code Standards & Automation (1 week)
2. Core Protocol Implementation (3-4 weeks)
3. Adapter Development (4-5 weeks)
4. Developer Tools (3-4 weeks)
5. Testing & CI (2-3 weeks)
6. Documentation & Demos (2-3 weeks)

**Total Phase 1 Timeline**: 8-12 weeks

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria:
- [ ] All adapters compile and pass integration tests
- [ ] Core and adapters published as v0.5.0+
- [ ] Live docs site with verified quickstart
- [ ] 90% code coverage achieved
- [ ] Security whitepaper published
- [ ] Zero critical issues

## Tools & Framework Decision

**Recommendation**: Use **Vibe-Coder MCP** as primary orchestration tool for PSP development because:
- Designed specifically for software development workflows
- Feature-driven development approach (perfect for PSP's complex features)
- Structured phase management (aligns with 5-phase plan)
- PRD generation capabilities
- Development-specific task tracking

**Task Manager MCP** would be overkill since Vibe-Coder handles the development workflow structure needed.

## Repository Status
- **Branch**: agent/bootstrap
- **Files Added**: 10 planning and task files
- **Commit**: adaf0c4 - "feat: add comprehensive PSP master plan and Phase 1 task breakdown"
- **Status**: Ready for development to begin

**The PSP project is now fully planned, structured, and ready for autonomous execution! 🚀**
